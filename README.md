Aim of this project is to find root cause of various vulnerabilities in cgroup-1. Control groups, usually referred to as cgroups, are a Linux kernel feature which allow processes to be organized into hierarchical groups whose usage of various types of resources can then be limited and monitored. In some exceptional cases process in Cgroup tends to affect restricted resources.  Here are some of the ways cgroup resources can be escaped. 




Creating Cgroup
    • OS used: Ubuntu 22.04
    • There exist a cgroup at /sys/fs/cgroup
We can creat a child cgroup by simply creating a directory in cgroup folder.
    • In new folder we can change values of resource controllers and add any process
